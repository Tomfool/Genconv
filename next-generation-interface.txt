The following things can be selected and reduced,
depending on the request.
-----
 - node_selection (a list of integers)
 - edge_selection (a list of integers)
 - observation_selection (a list of integers)
 - state_selection (a list of lists)
 - transition_row_selection (a list of lists)
 - transition_column_selection (a list of lists)

The following reductions can be specified.
The state reduction requires a state selection,
and transition reduction requires both transition row and column selection.
Other reductions have a default selection (select all, in their natural order).
-----
 - node_reduction
 - edge_reduction
 - observation_reduction
 - state_reduction
 - transition_reduction

The following linear aggregate functions can be used:
-----
 - "sum"
 - "avg"
 - coefficients of a linear combination

In the json interface, allow the order of the axes of the n-dimensional output
to be specified.
-----
 - node
 - edge
 - observation
 - state
 - transition

In the Python interface, allow the output to be provided as a pandas DataFrame.
The following indices are with respect to the selection order.
-----
 - node_index
 - edge_index
 - observation_index
 - state_index
 - transition_index

Also, allow redundant square brackets to be elided.
Square brackets are considered redundant if they can be added
without ambiguity.  This depends on the shapes of the 'scene' information.
