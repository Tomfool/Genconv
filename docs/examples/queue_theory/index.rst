queueing theory

These examples involve processes where the states are integers
that increase or decrease stochastically by one step at a time,
over continuous time.

These kinds of processes are also called birth-death processes.
When the count only increases and cannot decrease over time,
this is called a pure-birth process.
Similarly when the count only decreases and cannot increase over time,
this is called a pure-death process.

In some of the examples a complication that may be unusual
in traditional queueing theory is considered: a branching timeline.
